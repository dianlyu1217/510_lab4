# Lesson Learned
During my journey of technical improvement, I effectively utilized sqlite3 to develop and implement data models, ensuring the correctness of the data structure and the consistency of data in the application. Using the Pydantic class, I was able to not only quickly construct basic forms but also enhance the interactivity and functionality of the user interface through its advanced features, such as filterable dropdown menus. Moreover, I gained valuable experience in adjusting database structures, particularly in how to handle practical issues during database upgrades. I found that to prevent errors related to non-existent columns during database updates, it is crucial to delete the old sqlite file first, a key step in ensuring the stable operation of the application.


# questions
1.How can version control for database schemas be effectively managed to minimize disruption in a production environment?
2.What are some best practices for automating the migration of data when database schemas change, especially when using tools like sqlite3 in small to medium-sized projects?
